# Dho

Generate CircleCI config from `dhall` representations. 


## Preparations

Make sure you have `stack` installed and that you have a recent `stackage` snapshot in your global `stack` project (in `~/.stack/global-project/stack.yaml`). `LTS-12.12` will suffice.


## Installing

This will install `dhall-to-yaml` and `dhall-to-json` executables
`stack install dhall-json` 


## Running

`dhall-to-yaml <<< './example.dhall'`
